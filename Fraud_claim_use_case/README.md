# Assets for Cloud Pak for Data workshop/learning/modules

In this tutorials, we use IBM Cloud Pak for Data to go through the whole data science pipeline to solve a business problem - Fraud prediction in Auto Insurance claims. Cloud Pak for Data is an interactive, collaborative, cloud-based environment where data scientists, developers, and others interested in data science can use tools (e.g., RStudio, Jupyter Notebooks, Spark, etc.) to collaborate, share, and gather insight from their data as well as build and deploy machine learning and deep learning models.

When the reader has completed the lab tutorials, they will understand how to:

* Understand Cloud Pak for data and it's application
* Understand data virtualization
* Perform data visualization with Data Refinery
* Find, prepare, and understand data with Watson Knowledge Catalog
* Perform data analysis, model building with Watson Studio, and deploying with Watson Machine Learning
* Automate model building with AutoAI
* Monitor the model with Watson OpenScale
